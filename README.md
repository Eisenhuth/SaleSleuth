# SaleSleuth

### what is this
a reverse lookup tool to check what items retainers are selling

### how does it work
the tool takes a snapshot of the entire market on a world, using the latest data from the universalis.app API and then going through every available listing to check for the entered name(s)

### but why
a friend was curious if this was possible - and since I already did most of the work dealing with the APIs (using my packages [Eisenhuth/universalis-swift](https://github.com/Eisenhuth/universalis-swift) and [Eisenhuth/xivapi-swift](https://github.com/Eisenhuth/xivapi-swift)) this turned out to be fairly quick and easy
